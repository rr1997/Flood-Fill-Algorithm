# Flood-Fill-Algorithm

Like  MS-Paint, when we take the brush to a pixel and click, the color of the region of that pixel is replaced with a new selected color.
Following is the project to implement this task. 
Given a 2D screen, location of a pixel in the screen and a color,
replace color of the given pixel and all adjacent same colored pixels with the given color.
